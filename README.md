# Stats507

The purpose of this repository is to gather files/Problem Sets from Stats507 in one accessible location as well as to track changes for those files.

The file, [PS2Q3.py](/Users/micahscholes/PS2Q3.py) is a python script that reads in, cleans, and appends NHANES demographics and dental data from 2011-2018, then saves it to a pickle for ease of use in future problem sets for computations and models.
